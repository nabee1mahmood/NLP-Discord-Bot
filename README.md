# CS 4343 - Natural Language Processing Discord Bot

This project was built for the CS 4343 Natural Language Processing course. It's a Discord bot that uses NLP techniques to understand and respond to user input in a conversational way.

## About the Project

The goal of this project was to explore the practical applications of NLP by building an interactive system. Since Discord is widely used among students and developers, it made sense to create a bot that could live in that space and show off what weâ€™ve learned.

Our bot can understand basic commands, respond with relevant information, and even carry out simple tasks, such as summarizing text or answering questions, using language models.
