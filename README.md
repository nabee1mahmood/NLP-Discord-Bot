# CS 4343 - Natural Language Processing Discord Bot

This project was built for the CS 4343 Natural Language Processing course. It's a Discord bot that uses NLP techniques to understand and respond to user input in a conversational way.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

The goal of this project was to explore practical applications of NLP by building something interactive. Since Discord is widely used among students and developers, it made sense to create a bot that could live in that space and show off what weâ€™ve learned.

Our bot can understand basic commands, respond with relevant information, and even carry out simple tasks like summarizing text or answering questions using language models.

## Features

- Text summarization  
- Question answering  
- Basic conversational responses  
- Command handling with natural language understanding  
- Easy to deploy with a token-based auth system

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Discord.py  
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, T5)  
- NLTK / SpaCy  
- Flask (for local API testing)

## What We Learned

This project gave us hands-on experience with:
- Tokenization and embeddings  
- Using pre-trained NLP models  
- Handling API calls and bot deployment  
- Debugging model behavior in real-time conversations
